# Voice of Germany 2018 Report

## Abstract
Each year, the 'The Voice' television contest is organized in different countries around the world.
In it, participants compete with their voice and their performances to be chosen and win the final, becoming 'The Voice' of the country.

## Motivation
During the broadcast of the show is growing an interest from the users towards the participants.

Each participant has a story and information:
age, origin, style, etc...
In addition, each participant shows an evolution in the program:
quality,  character, the songs they sing, the performances, their relationship with the coaches and other participants, etc...
All this information is generated throughout the broadcast program and content in the web and is perceived and transmitted by users on social networks.

The rules of the contest allow the initial decision of which participants continue and who does not, of course, reside in the coaches.
Then it is up to the users to decide, through their votes, which participants will continue in the show until the finals.
In this period it is interesting to observe if there are indicators among all the generated data that correspond with the selection results.


## Target
The aim of this project is to analyse the data generated during the broadcasting period of the TV show.

The dataset contains information about candidates, coaches and teams, information about performance and evolution of the social networks.
Using these datasets different analysis and visualization tools will be applied.

This project has no predictive pretension.
The objective is to define a series of analytical questions and implement the necessary tools to answer them.
Specific areas of study are:
- evolution of users in social networks
- correlation of social networks with other factors
